P1: 
- The project team must meet and agree on the web site's purpose, goals, audience, and
final location of the website with the client.
- The meeting/brainstorming should result in a draft of the requirements for the website, which
should be made before the meeting with your project advisor:

 functional requirements:
 non-functional requirements:


 - Considerations when making the requirements:
● What is the motivation for the target group to visit the website?
● How will they get what they seek?
● Is there more than one kind of user?
● Should two topics definitely be on the same page? Should there be a direct link
between two things? Many times, these won't matter and should be left to design
(P2), but sometimes there are particular requirements.
● How important is the appearance of the website, compared to the content? Is a
particular color scheme required, or does the client have a preferred layout? Once
you start talking about graphical design, it is easy to get ahead of yourself.
